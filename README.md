# Flowfield
A javascript implementation of the flowfield algorithm in the paper https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/crowd-flows/78-treuille.pdf by Treuille, Cooper, and Popovic. This algorithm is used for pathfinding with large groups. 
 
Simply run the main.html file with any modern browser. 
The simulation entails four different groups of individuals with various sizes and speeds, each on one side of the window trying to get to the opposite side.

As we can see in this video, the red group parts down the middle to make way for the blue group and the yellow group parts way to make way for all the other groups going across the screen.
